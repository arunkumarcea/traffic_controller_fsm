Above stop specification(s) might not have been used in current analysis due
to any of the following reasons :

1. Design unit specified by "stop" has no definition or not part of analyzed hierarchy
2. Files specified by "stopfile/stopdir" do not exist or have been ignored by ignorefile option
3. Files specified by "stopfile/stopdir" have been specified for precompiled files and are wild card expressions
4. Stop specification has not been used as it might be overlapping with earlier stop specification
