# 
# This report consists of the following sections:
# A. Setup and Design Audit: To be reviewed for correctness 
#    This section is composed of following data:
#       a. Tool Setup: parameters and constraints 
#       b. Run Information 
#       c. Design Audit 
#       d. Formal setup 
#     === What to do: 
#       Review tool setup to make sure all assumptions and definitions are correct.
#       Review design audit as needed.
# B. Setup Audit Information: To be reviewed for setup signoff 
#     This section reports result of rules which ensure that: 
#       a. Registers are properly clocked and reset 
#       b. Setup and constraints do not conflict with each other 
#       c. No clocks are defined in the fanout of other clocks
#     === What to do: 
#       Make sure no violation is reported.
# C. Analysis and Verification: To be reviewed for CDC verification signoff 
#     This section reports result of rules which ensure that: 
#       a. There is no meta-stability problem across clock domains.
#       b. There is no issue with correlated signals crossing clock domains. 
#       c. There is no data loss for signals crossing a fast clock domain to a 
#          slow clock domain.
#       d. Complex synchronizers such as FIFO and Handshake are working properly.
#     Shows the CDC analysis and the number of synchronized and unsynchronized 
#     crossings in the design. Also, shows other CDC-related rule information.
# D. Best Practices:
#     Reports issues with design styles in clocks, resets and crossings.
